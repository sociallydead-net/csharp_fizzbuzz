 * A reply to an awesome video by Tom Scott (I am a big fan!)
 * You can see his video and this javascript version here:

 * Meanwhile leave it to me to complety overengineer a childs game :)
 * My solution seperates the evaluation and the rendering, it also
 * works on a "ruleSet" so you can change the number and text in a 
 * central place, you can also easily at a 3rd or 4th value etc.
 * 
 * Also I HATE else statements because they can become messy really fast,
 * so if you wonder why I dont use else in the render part that is why!
 * 
 * I hope you like my solution, and if it helps you at a job interview you
 * can buy me a beer over paypal: afischer@jsyntax.com
